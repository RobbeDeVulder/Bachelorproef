  abstract     = {Sports research and betting have been powered by quick exposure to the Internet and machine learning popularity. Football is considered the most popular game in 200 countries and contrasts to other sports. It is considered much more diverse and complicated, making soccer an enticing area to do research. A variety of methodologies and methods are used for the production of prediction systems. We expect the outcome of a match between the Premier League and a home side. The projections are based on numerous significant evidences from the Premier League's previous seasons. These essential characteristics would possibly decide the result of a match. We use three different algorithms to predict the machine learning techniques and then choose from those three the best algorithm for predicting the label.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, football (soccer) has aroused an increasing amount of attention across continents and entered unexpected dimensions. In this course, the number of bookmakers, who offer the opportunity to bet on the outcome of football games, expanded enormously, which was further strengthened by the development of the world wide web. In this context, one could generate positive returns over time by betting based on a strategy which successfully identifies overvalued betting odds. Due to the large number of matches around the globe, football matches in particular have great potential for such a betting strategy. This paper utilizes machine learning to forecast the outcome of football games based on match and player attributes. A simulation study which includes all matches of the five greatest European football leagues and the corresponding second leagues between 2006 and 2018 revealed that an ensemble strategy achieves statistically and economically significant returns of 1.58 percent per match. Furthermore, the combination of different machine learning algorithms could neither be outperformed by the individual machine learning approaches nor by a linear regression model or naive betting strategies, such as always betting on the victory of the home team.},

This paper proposes a football match result prediction method based on edge computing and machine learning technology. Specifically, the authors first extract some game data from the results of the previous games to construct the common features and characteristic features, respectively. Then, the feature extraction and classification task are deployed to multiple edge nodes. Finally, the results in all the edge nodes are uploaded to the cloud server and fused to make a decision. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning has become an integral part of engineering design and decision making in several domains, including sports. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been the state-of-the-art methods for predicting outcomes of professional sports events. However, apart from getting highly accurate predictions on these sports events outcomes, it is necessary to answer questions such as "Why did the model predict that Team A would win Match X against Team B?" DNNs are inherently black-box in nature. Therefore, it is required to provide high-quality interpretable and understandable explanations for a model's prediction in sports. This paper explores a two-phased Explainable Artificial Intelligence(XAI) approach to predict outcomes of matches in the Brazilian volleyball League (SuperLiga). In the first phase, we directly use the interpretable rule-based ML models that provide a global understanding of the model's behaviors based on Boolean Rule Column Generation (BRCG; extracts simple AND-OR classification rules) and Logistic Regression (LogReg; allows to estimate the feature importance scores). In the second phase, we construct non-linear models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) to obtain predictive performance on the volleyball matches' outcomes. We construct the "post-hoc" explanations for each data instance using ProtoDash, a method that finds prototypes in the training dataset that are most similar to the test instance, and SHAP, a method that estimates the contribution of each feature on the model's prediction. We evaluate the SHAP explanations using the faithfulness metric. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the explanations for the model's predictions.},

These models are based on numerous factors involved in the games, such as the results of historical matches, player performance indicators, and opposition information. This paper provides a critical analysis of the literature in ML, focusing on the application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to sport results prediction. In doing so, we identify the learning methodologies utilised, data sources, appropriate means of model evaluation, and specific challenges of predicting sport results.

  abstract     = {Football prediction has become an interesting problem, and researchers are trying to find solutions that are different from each other. The idea of modeling and building a smart model that studies the available data and expects the outcome of the game has become more popular and widespread in the past few years. Professionally different predictive methods have been developed to assess the characteristics that cause a soccer team to lose a match or win a match. Machine Learning (ML) is one of the branches of artificial intelligence that is concerned with designing algorithms that allow computers to have the advantage of learning without programming the rules for each issue. These algorithms consist of a series of commands, and instructions necessary to direct the machine or computer to how the tasks should be carried out, as the algorithms play the role of the mastermind in the machine because of its polarization of data, collection, analysis and finally relying on the analyzed data to determine how the task should be performed. The algorithms used in machine learning rely on a set of graphical models and decision tools such as the decision tree, natural language processing, and artificial neural networks for the task of automating analyzed data and processing; thus, motivating the machine to make decisions and carry out the tasks assigned to it with precision and ease. This paper implements three ML algorithms; Decision Forest (DF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the match result. The result showed that DF achieved the highest accuracy of 89 percent, ANN achieved the accuracy of 72 percent, and SVM achieved the accuracy of 70 percent. It is worth noting that the prediction results are obtained based on 10-folds cross-validation.},
